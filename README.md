# SoftwareTechnology-CapstoneProject

This project and the following analysis is based on the dataset of TESLA Stock Price Prediction built by A.Mohan Kumar, available from Kaggle repository (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amohankumar/tesla-stock-price-prediction-dataset)
   
*   The dataset includes the stock price details of TESLA from the 29th of September, 2021 to the 29th of September, 2022.

*   This project aims to create a machine learning model which can predict the future trend of TESLA stock price according to the characteristics of data.

*   To resolve this issue, I took a systematic approach, developed a data analysis and prediction model step by step. This model implemented various Python packages, modules, and classes (including machine learning and regression algorithms) to achieve the desired outcome.
