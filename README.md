# SoftwareTechnology-CapstoneProject

This project and the following analysis is based on the dataset of TESLA Stock Price Prediction built by A.Mohan Kumar, available from Kaggle repository (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amohankumar/tesla-stock-price-prediction-dataset)
   
* The dataset includes the stock price details of TESLA from the 29th of September, 2021 to the 29th of September, 2022.

* This project aims to create a machine learning model which can predict the future trend of TESLA stock price according to the characteristics of data.

* To resolve this issue, I took a systematic approach, developed a data analysis and prediction model step by step. This model implemented various Python packages, modules, and classes (including machine learning and regression algorithms) to achieve the desired outcome.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Predictive Data Analysis (PDA) are included in `Capstone_Project.ipynb`.
2. Two deployment methods are presented: Deployment using Tkinter is detailed within `Capstone_Project.ipynb`. Deployment using Streamlit can be accessed by clicking on `Deployment.py`.
